                <h3>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h3>
                <p>Workplace culture doesn't start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge,<br>and it doesn't end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It's the unwritten rules,<br> behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it's<br> what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel<br> valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to<br>succeed.</p>
                <p>In Aaron's session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that<br> *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments,<br> and companies have that others don't, and more importantly, how to begin to<br> change your own workplace's culture. Once you've worked within a culture of<br> design it's almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>           
                <h3>ABOUT AARON</h3>
                <p>Aaron Irizarry is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover of heavy<br> metal, a foodie, and a master of BBQ arts. You can find some of his thoughts and<br> presentations on the conversation surrounding design over at<br> <a href="">discussingdesign.com.</a></p>

                <h3>LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS</h3>
                <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a<br> combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It's the<br> filmmaker's job to put this together. To do so they've developed processes, tools<br> and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information,<br> foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told<br> story.</p>
                <p>With this workshop, we'll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on<br> the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We'll look at some tools used in <br>film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We'll consider why<br> they're used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>           
                <h3>ABOUT ADAM</h3>
